# GimpPlugin--Resize-photo-to-6x4
Re-sizing pictures to a clean printable photo size just with one Click.

Why I created this plugin because I create laser engravings photos and need to resize the pictures all the time. I wrote the code to save me time. 

Once you use this code. The plugin in will be under tab READY PICTURE.

Install:
C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins

Rename extension file to .py and put into the folder

Any Problems let me know.
